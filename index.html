      <h2>What is a puzzle game?</h2>
      <As mentioned before, puzzle games can come in different styles, as long as there is a “problem solving” process. In other words, solving a puzzle is also “finding the best strategies”.  In a broad sense, competitive games like CS or League of legends can have puzzle game features, as players need to develop strategies to counter enemies and achieve victory. The problem here can be “which site to take gives me more advantage”, or “in what order should I kill enemies”. 
However, there are certain criteria that makes a puzzle considered a good one. In essence, a good puzzle should be fun (which is obviously the key to every game), and it has a right answer (even more than one). The Legend of Zelda, for example, is considered the benchmark for puzzle games in recent years. To solve the puzzles, players can use the materials they collect, and the mechanisms of this game allow players to approach a goal from infinite different ways. If you haven’t played this game, this video tells you what people can do in this game (you can even make a rocket!)
