      <h2>Riddle of Sphinx</h2>
      <p>“What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?” Ever since ancient Greek, human beings have a long history of interest in riddles, or “problem solving”. I feel we just have this natural love of riddles. Physiologically, the sense of achievement when solving a problem (particularly a difficult one) would trigger the release of dopamine in our bodies, and emotionally it’s something you can show off about.</p>
      <p>Puzzle games are like a modern division of “riddles”, where players have to solve different puzzles in games. These puzzles often have very different forms in various video games (thanks to the creativity of games designers), but the fundamental logic here is quite similar – players solving the puzzles that the game designers propose, often within the framework built by the designers while using the tools that they provide.</p>

    <section id="what-is-a-puzzle-game">
      <h2>What is a puzzle game?</h2>
      <p>As mentioned before, puzzle games can come in different styles, as long as there is a “problem solving” process. In other words, solving a puzzle is also “finding the best strategies”. In a broad sense, competitive games like CS or League of Legends can have puzzle game features, as players need to develop strategies to counter enemies and achieve victory. The problem here can be “which site to take gives me more advantage”, or “in what order should I kill enemies”.</p>
      <p>However, there are certain criteria that makes a puzzle considered a good one. In essence, a good puzzle should be fun (which is obviously the key to every game), and it has a right answer (even more than one). <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, for example, is considered the benchmark for puzzle games in recent years. To solve the puzzles, players can use the materials they collect, and the mechanisms of this game allow players to approach a goal from infinite different ways.</p>

    <section id="metroidbrainia-intro">
      <h2>Yeah… I know what are puzzle games… So what?</h2>
      <p>Now I would like to introduce a very specific sub-genre of puzzle game: Metroidbrania. This word is derived from “Metroidvania”, which refers to the games that are similar to Nintendo’s game series Metroid and Castlevania. The core gameplay of these games is fighting enemies, collecting items and leveling up to enter the next region in a large map.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="knowledge-gates">
      <h2>Knowledge gates</h2>
      <p>So, what does “level up your brain” mean? In Metroidbrania games, it means to overcome obstacles by gaining certain knowledge. In other words, instead of actual weapons or items in the games, metroidbrania games offers you a virtual “item” that stays in your head. The gates or obstacles you need to pass is not an actual enemy or gate that needs a key, but a “knowledge gate”. If you ever replay the game, you will not have to recollect this item and can clear the stage with your memory.</p>
      <p>A very recent example of how well-designed metroidbrania game should work is the game Öoo. In the video at 21 seconds, we can see basically the only instructions of this game, telling you that left click would let you character lay a bomb, and right click could set off the bomb. However, what the bomb can do remains unknown to players until they try to create a bomb and trigger it—it blows the character to the air! This is how player learns the function of the bomb: it lets the character “jump”, potentially reaching a higher place.</p>
      <p>Then, players would probably notice the blue blocks to the right of the screen—it is different to the purple blocks (which seems to be the wall). If players try to blow up the blue blocks with the bomb, they will learn that the blue blocks disappear and would regenerate after 5 seconds. Players can travel through this gap before the regeneration of the blue blocks.</p>
      <p>What else is the bomb capable of? Very soon, the game would teach you by presenting this trap with spikes in the pit. With a little thinking, you may realize that if you place the bomb behind you, it can also let you travel horizontally.</p>
      <p>So far, the only instruction given directly by the game designer is that how to use the mouse to set and detonate the bomb. However, without noticing, the player figures out the functions of the bomb by themselves: it destroys blue blocks, let players travel horizontally and vertically. With all this knowledge gained, the player is able to solve the puzzles later, using a combination of all these techniques.</p>

    <section id="perceiving-the-world">
      <h2>Perceiving the world</h2>
      <p>The experiencing of this investigation of puzzle games, metroidbrania and knowledge gates has potentially also changed my way of perceiving the world (in a very subtle scale, though). A lot of perspectives in real life can also be considered as “knowledge gates” to some extent. Solution of a mathematical question, interpersonal communication, even housekeeping may all have this invisible “knowledge gate” that requires a key from particular later knowledge so it can be solved either more efficiently, effectively or just more fun. Sometimes if there’s a feeling that the current solution is not the best solution, but you are unable to find any better answer, just be patient and there might soon be a “Eurika”.</p>

    <section id="acing-party-games">
      <h2>Acing party games</h2>
      <p>There is a popular party game (or ice breaking game) that I like a lot in Chinese called “Hai Gui Tang”. Its literal translation is “Sea turtle soup”, and from Wikipedia it is called “situation puzzle”. Players need to ask yes or no questions to the host to restore the full picture of a story from a very vague description. For example, the prompt can be “A man pushed a car to a hotel and lost all his fortune.” and the solution is “they are playing monopoly”. Clearly the prompt often sounds very absurd and random, but there are certain questions that help me locate the correct solution quickly which I summarize from playing this game for many times. For example, “Do I refer to a natural human” would identify whether the game is based on human or maybe animals or objects, whether there is supernatural power involved, etc, as “I” in this game usually can refer to anything, not just human.</p>
      <p>This is another example of a “key” to “knowledge gates”. Similarly, this technique can also be used in escape rooms, imposters, even gartic phone.</p>

    <section id="acknowledgements">
      <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
      <p>At the end of this article, I would like to thank this video for introducing the game Öoo to me which provides me the very first inspiration on this whole essay. This video is in Chinese, and the title can be translated into “The best design in puzzle games is knowledge gate”. It shows the gameplay of Öoo. This video doesn’t introduce what a “knowledge lock” is, yet put it on its title, which triggered my curiosity and completed this whole article. I would also encourage you to play this game Öoo and you will have a fantastic gaming experience.</p>
      <p>I would also like to acknowledge this article which lays the foundations of the research to metroidbrania and knowledge gates.</p>
